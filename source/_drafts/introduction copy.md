Good morning. My name is Zhao Kaijie, a Senior Java Developer with over seven years of specialized experience in back-end development. I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate how my expertise can contribute to your team.

I specialize in full-stack Java back-end development and possess advanced expertise in Spring Ecosystem technologies, including Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security. My core strength lies in architecting and developing microservices-based business servers that streamline complex requirements. Specifically, I've:

Abstracted intricate business logic into scalable system workflows
Reduced development cycles by 15-30% across three major projects
Beyond my professional work, I maintain coding passion projects to expand my technical breadth, experimenting with GUI development and game engines alongside web servers.

As a current Senior Java Developer at Citi Financial, I own maintenance of our Deal Transaction Management System while leading backend server development for client-driven business requirements. I actively integrate technical advancements into our workflows.

Earlier at Ctrip as a Senior Java Back-end Developer, I spearheaded development for the train ticketing platform where I:

Migrated legacy monolithic systems to microservices
Collaborated across four teams to unify API standards
